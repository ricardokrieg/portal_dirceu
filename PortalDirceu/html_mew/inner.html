<h4>Details About Our New Trade Review System</h4>
<h5>SUN SEPTEMBER 1</h5>

<p>Our new trade review system is finally here and with it comes a lot of improvements to how trades on FantasyBowl work, as well as (we hope) a bit of fun.

Some background first. Trading in sports is as old as sports itself, and has always been an integral part of fantasy sports. Some would consider "wheeling and dealing" to be half the fun. But there are also downsides to trades. Collusion is the obvious one, but "anti-traders" (teams that vote down trades regardless of their merit) can also make for a bad 
experience.

We wanted to tackle both of these problems (among others) with one universal solution, and thus the site-wide trade review system was born. No longer are players in your own league voting on the league's trades, but rather players in all other leagues on FantasyBowl give their impartial opinion on trades up for review.

Trades are initiated between two teams like they always have, with teams agreeing on players to trade. The difference is that once a trade between these teams is agreed upon, it instantly goes up for site-wide review. Review on that trade can be voted on by anyone owning a FantasyBowl prize league team for the current season. The exception is that the users involved in the trade and the users of the teams in the league the trade is taking place in will not be allowed to vote on that trade to keep the voting impartial.
